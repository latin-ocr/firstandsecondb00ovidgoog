Trus book conforms to the general plan oi the series
of School Classics. A limited portion oi the Metamor-
phoses has been selected, with the expectation that other
volumes will follow, thus enabling the teacher at different
times to read from various parts oi the poem. Some
omissions have been made in the first and second books

of passages not adapted tor reading in the secondary

schools, but not in sufficient amount to render obscure
the continuity ol the work. This important matter is

also helped by a brief summary in English of the omitted n

passages.
While certain schools with a long course in Latin read

irorn twenty-five hundred to three thousand lines of Ovid, ”’

Ιῐὴετε are many others that can read but fifteen hundred
lines. Some model programs and reports call lor the
latter number. This book, therefore, has been made to
contain fifteen hundred lines by the addition ol Ovid's
Autobiography, which not only serves as a basis for the
study ol Ovid's life, but also introduces the student to

the elegiae pentameter.
